This repository contains a JavaScript implementation of **PokerBo**, a unique and exciting casino game that blends elements of poker and sic bo. Originally created by Club Gaming Pty LTD (a subsidiary of Crown Casino), PokerBo was a popular table game at Crown Casino in Melbourne, Australia. Although the physical table was removed in 2021, this project brings the game back to life in a digital format.

### What is PokerBo?

PokerBo offers a thrilling gaming experience with no competition between players.  Instead, everyone focuses on the suspense of the draw, creating a sense of camaraderie as players anticipate the outcome of their wagers. With payouts ranging from 1:1 to 500:1, there's potential for big wins and exciting moments.

### Game Rules

  * **Decks:** Six standard decks of cards are used.

  * **Wagers:** Players can place bets on nine different outcomes:

      * **Straight 'n' Up:**  Pays based on the highest poker hand formed (e.g., Straight, Flush, Full House, etc.).
      * **Three of a Kind:** Pays 20:1 for three-of-a-kind (including hands that also qualify as a flush).
      * **Two Pair:** Pays 13:1 for two pairs (including hands that also qualify as a flush).
      * **Pair:** Pays 1:1 for a pair (including hands that also qualify as a flush).
      * **No Hand:** Pays if the highest hand is Ace-high or less.
      * **Specific Suit:** Four separate bets (Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds, Spades), each paying based on the number of cards of that suit in the final hand.
      * **Five of a Kind Flush:** Pays for a five-card straight flush.

  * **Gameplay:**

    1.  Players place their bets on any combination of wager types.
    2.  The dealer draws five cards from the shuffled deck and reveals them.
    3.  Winning wagers are determined based on the poker hands formed.
