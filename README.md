This is a Javascript implementation of the PokerBo game, a fun and fast-paced variation of the classic Stud Poker game. PokerBo was created by Club Gaming Pty LTD, a fully owned subsidiary of Crown Casino, and used to be a table game at Crown Casino in Melbourne, Australia.
The PokerBo table was removed from Crown in 2021, however, I always enjoyed playing the game, so I've recreated it in Javascript!


## A UNIQUE TWIST ON POKER AND SICBO
Combining elements of two casino favourites, Poker and Sibo, Poker Bo features no competitive element between players and so games are often filled with the buzz of comradery with players watching in suspense to see if their wagers have won anywhere from a 1:1 pay-out to 500:1.

## Game Information

- Six decks of ordinary cards are used.
- The Straight 'n' Up bet pays based on the highest poker value of the hand. In the event the hand qualifies for multiple wins, only the higher/highest ranking poker hand shall apply.
- The Three of a Kind bet shall pay 20 to 1 if the poker value of the hand is a three of a kind, including a hand that can be scored as both a flush and three of a kind. It will not pay on a full house, four of a kind, or five of a kind.
- The Two Pair bet shall pay 13 to 1 if the poker value of the hand is a two pair, including a hand that can be scored as both a flush and two pair. It will not pay on a full house, four of a kind, or five of a kind.
- The Pair bet shall pay 1 to 1 if the poker value of the hand is a pair, including a hand that can be scored as both a flush and pair. It will not pay on a two pair, three of a kind, full house, four of a kind, or five of a kind.
- The No Hand bet shall pay if the poker value of the hand is ace high or less.
- There are four Specific Suit bets, one for each suit. Each pays according to the number of cards in the chosen suit in the five-card poker hand.

I've also added a Five of a Kind Flush bet which was not present in the original game.

## Objective
The aim of the game is to achieve any of the nine 
permissible wagers: Straight 'n' Up, Three of a Kind, 
Two Pair, Pair, No Pair, or by suit – Hearts, Clubs, 
Diamonds or Spades

## How to play 
There are nine permissible wagers that a player may 
place each round.

To begin, players place their bets on any combination of the six wager types available; Straight ‘n’ Up, Three of a Kind, Two Pair, Pair, No Hand and Specific Suit.

When all betting has taken place, the dealer indicates to all players that there are no more bets.

The dealer then draws five cards from the deck and reveals each of the cards.

The dealer then checks the card values to see if any Poker hands have been made and checks against each players wagers. If any wagers placed match with a Poker hand, the player is then awarded the appropriate pay-out.
